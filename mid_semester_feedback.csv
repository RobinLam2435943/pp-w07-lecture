5,"Going through misconceptions, common errors in quizzes. ","Create a poll, so students can ask for clarifications/questions, and we can spend time if many students have the same question",Working through tasks together as a group with help from tutors.,Everything is good :)

7,I think the tutorial sheets are the most useful.,"Monday lectures are too short and too passive, hence we aren't able to get much from the in-person lecture. I wish to get more involved in the lecture. Perhaps ask the questions all the time on top hat to keeps as focus on the lecture.",The chance to collaborate and learn/teach/help friends. We learn while we teach or help friends.,Please make attendance compulsory. Students are not attending the workshops and make it hard to collaborate.

9,"The tutorial notebooks are quite useful. Every week I can learn a lot from it. Besides, the lectures are the most interesting way for me to learn Python.",Nothing for me.,"In the workshop, we can communicate with our classmates and seek for help any time we need, which is very useful.",Everything is pretty good.
10,"it leads me to the fundamental of python as I haven't contract it before, and I like the style of the lecture. It's interesting and meaningful. The notes are all very helpful in including lots of details and I could ask for help from the lecturer and TA. It's great!",tutorial sheets are a little bit more to read all of them before workshop,TA could solve my questions,it needs more time to finish the task of workshops. 2h is not enough
11,a lot useful code skills and algorithm ideas,link to lecture tutorial,improve teamwork and code ability,just ok
12,yes,everything is fine,I can practice more using python,no

15,Monday lectures and tutorial sheets.,I think now everything is fine. Just if we can have a unified notebook which can includes the all materials that will be nice.,"The tutors. When I have any question, I can ask tutors. During that process, I felt interactive and also learned a lot new things.",I hope we can be assigned to some small teams. I feel a little bit hard to ask others to cooperate with. The guy you grouped with today may not come next week. Then you need find another classmates but they may already have been grouped.
16,The tutorial sheets,-,"The fact that we work in teams and receive a lot of help, information and feedback from the assistants. ",-

20,The videos.,"Monday lectures, I cannot keep pace with the speed of teacher typing the code.","Discussion and sometimes we can directly ask the assistant teacher, it is useful.","NO, perfect!"

22,"First of all, the explanations of each section in notes are very detailed, and there are many places to practice. There are videos available for each tutorial, which I think are very useful.","I think the content of the lecture each week is not closely related to the content of notes. I think the content of the lecture can be put in notes in advance, and then we can practice and train the content of this part in the lecture.","The workshop provides many opportunities for us to interact with lecturers and teaching assistants. If you have any questions you don't understand, you can get timely feedback and communication, which is helpful to our learning.","I think the workshop can grasp the overall progress. The process of tasks done by each group is different. At the appropriate time, if the teacher can mention the key points and key steps of the task together. I think we can speed up the progress of each group."
23," the rich example is the most useful aspect, which can help me to understand the knowledge.",maybe more videos.,group work.,maybe add some hints
24,the quiz and tutorial notebook,Could you plz upload the code in Monday's lecture,get familiar with the working flow,"Sometimes, it's too difficult so that we might not finish the task( do hope provide more clues"
25,recording videos and lectures,nope,people can work together and it helps us find more interesting solutions,no
26,the videos,better if more practical examples are included in the videos,practical examples,none
27,The workshops are very useful,The lectures on monday are sadly just a waste of my time.,The problems are interesting and the support is good.,Last weeks problem was comparably hard.
28,Organizational efforts of course flow ,,To train on concepts ,

30,"Monday lectures!
What the professor explained was very clear.",none,Discussion with group members can help me understand,none
31,"Worksheets, videos and lecture recording.",-,Discussing programming problems with classmates.,A workshop at the George Square campus would be amazing.
32,All aspects are pretty useful for this course. ,The pace of the lectures could be a little slower.,-,-
33,The examples and documents' links.,Lecture's time is too short. What we can learn in class is very limited. And tutorial sheets have too much content and new knowledge. It is hard for us to finish all tasks and read all documents within a week.,Help from teachers and tutors.,More tutors please.
34,The videos are the most useful.,The pace of the lecture is too fast.,"When I have questions, tutor can always give me a good answer.",Nothing.
35,The tutorial sheets is the most useful information for me to study the basic definition and usage of python. It provides me some detailed examples and exercises to practice.,The Monday lectures is a little fast for me to type the codes and I think it is better for us if teacher can give the lecture codes in advance.,The teamwork is a good way for us to discuss some difficult problems.,I think workshop is perfect and there is nothing to be improved.
36,the tutorial sheets,videos,learn how to use github to colloborate with teammates,everything is good
37,I found that the tutorial worksheets and the videos help me understand the concepts of Python a lot. ,"It would be better if the Python lecture could be shifted to other times of the day (maybe 14:00 - 15:00 or 15:00 - 16:00) since I am struggling with having lunch (outside of King's Building campus -- there are few restaurants there) and catching a shuttle bus at noon, which is a rush hour.  ",Having the chance to use GitHub with colleagues and consult with the Course Organizer and Teaching Assistants interactively more often ,Answer keys/ templates may be appreciated! 
38,Tutorial sheets and Monday lecture,illustrate more example in the Monday class,"Give us enough time to finish the practice problem,which is very important to python programming",No improve is needed
39,"_Monday lectures, the videos_",I do not know what the target of tutorial sheet is.,we could discuss with classmates,sometimes it is a litttle bit comfusing and the efficiency could be improved.
40,Tutorial sheet,None,None,None
41,I think the most useful aspect is the tips you give in lectures.,I think for a beginner course i would have liked to rely more on the lectures than on finding my own free courses for understanding the things in the video. ,i think having people to ask particular questions about the terminal errors. that takes a lot of time to figure out by yourself. I really liked the first one with the pear-coding.,"I think the tasks could be shorter, and less mathematical. I lost a lot of time figuring out what i had to do as i didn't learn maths in english. I think the mixed backgrounds of the course could benefit from different approaches to the same task. "
42,-,-,-,-
43,I think this lecture includes many useful knowledge for me to learn python with zero basis. Everything from software installation to learning are smooth. ,I think it is all good and nothing need to improve.,I can discuss some problems with my classmates and learn from them.,"I hope that teacher can lead us to do some essential and difficult process during the class, because we my get stuck in the beginning and it takes a long time to solve it."
44,The Monday lectures,Until know everything is very okay!,I don't find it very useful for me writing code with other people.,"I would prefer to have a look at the workshop exercises in advance, and just go to the workshops for asking questions. That would be more beneficial for me. "

48,Monday lectures.,Videos.,The way of thinking.,It is already great!

50,"The weekly videos could be the most useful aspect of this course, since I have no programming experience before. And the content I could only grasp on just in the video, others such as lecture and tutorial are too complicated for fresh coding student.  ","I would say there are ample content in every week's document. But it still easily to get lost when reading and practice it. For example, some people may don't have that much mathematics backgrounds, and we might spend lots of time first before practicing code. 

In addition,I supposed that doesn't make sense for us having a class with mathematics student as well, since the questions we practice are to focus on mathematics. I suggest that should we have more real world cases application base on our program objectives when learning python, rather than advanced math.",There are assistants in classroom.,"The students have various level of programming, we can see some students completed it in 20minutes, and others might still struggling of the content from video, tutorial and lectures, there are huge gap among our classmates. 

The workshop is not that effective as imagine, take me for example, I spent a lot of time to ask why should we set up the environment on our laptop like this, and understand the unfamiliar code from tutorial and lectures and so on. For those who have only purely business background, we still need have a comprehensive lessons to know the Introduction to Computers. In conclusion, my opinion is the students from different major and different ability of coding is hard to have a coherent learning outcome, and that might cause several potential learning issues."
51,The instructor is really insightful and covered Bit packaging problem in a different way using and blocks and notes,I think the course is being taken very quickly. This is common perception of people from non computer science/IT background. Should consider giving pre-requisites before admission.,Workshops with teams is definitely good and driver-reader mode is useful to many.,"Instead of 2-hour workshops, it could be 1.5 hour session and 30 mins can be allocated for Q/A session or maybe the instructors could summarise topics from lecture/workshops videos from Learn."

53,the tutorial sheet,all good,the workshop task helps me to understands more deeply,sometime I am not able to find the partner to complete the workshop together

56,_ Monday lectures and the videos_,"_if videos can be longer, that would be so much great_

_and i also wish tutorial sheets could be more detailed_","instructions for us to programming
solutions",if there would be more details and instructions everyweek
57,-,-,-,-
58,-,-,-,-
59,Monday lectures help me to understand more about the case and the code(s) needed. Charlotte provide explanation on how the code will do. ,The lectures already done greatly.,I love how Charlotte and her team keep an eye on the students. Asking how we are going with the tasks and gives some advise needed.,"It is my understanding that the workshop is supposed to be an opportunity where we can do the coding by ourself, however, since the workshop class is more conducive and focus, I think it will be great if there are some explanation about the coding first while we did the coding just like in our Principles of Data Analytics Workshop class."
60,The examples in the notes are helpful for us to better understand the concepts discussed in the lecture.,All the aspects are good enough.,"It creates a oppotunity for us to discuss problems and share opinions with each other, and it is convenient to raise questions to the teacher and tutors.",All the aspects of the workshop are very good.
61,I think the Monday lectures is the most useful part.,"I think the Monday lecture could be longer, because just 1 hour is too short to learn some new knowledge. ","It could enable me to be more familiar with the code, and to know how to write it by myself.","I think maybe more feedback for the workshop is needed, because sometimes we don't know whether we can write the code better."
62,the videos and the fact that solutions to questions are always posted,create more of a tie in with the workshops and lectures sometimes they feel a bit disjoint,being able to ask questions both instructor and lecturer seem very happy to answer even 'stupid' questions. Makes me feel more relaxed about it,i wish there was more of an individual aspect to the workshops. Sometimes it's difficult to get work done if you're slower and other people want to progress further without you. Sometimes makes me give up and wait for solutions to be posted
63,-,-,-,-
64,"It is to tell us what we can do by using python, such as we know we can use numpy to deal with some problems, we can use matplotlib to draw the diagram and so on.",It is wonderful.,"To see different questions, and try to solve it. If we face the problem, the tutor will help, which save lots of time.",No
65,-,should have covered the video stuffs in lectures,-,-
66,"The way of thinking about how to solve a problem in lecture 6 is the most useful for me. Besides, I also learn a habit of seeing the documentation and using the network to find solutions.","nothing, all great","Maybe nothing, the situations of workshops are the same as writing code in my home, which is solving a problem given by the professor and checking the answer with the solution.LOL",sorry i do not know
67,"Python is a new programming language for me but the lectures, videos, and tutorials help me to understand it. The way you explain the programming logic during the lecture and how to think during bug fixing/problem solving is very insightful for me.","I don't know if it's possible, but I think an hour lecture is too short. Maybe if we can combine the duration of the lecture and the workshop (so add more time for the lecture) will be better.","It's a good way to practice especially for someone new to Python like me. I can ask and discuss, get a lot of insight and get ideas from my colleague.","So far so good. Maybe will be better if students get like rolling colleague (decided by you/your team) so will help the students to meet new friends (and get new insights, ideas, etc). Some people just tend to do workshops from week to week with the same colleague again and again."
68,"The weekly pre-class video allows me to have time to understand the main content of this week's class in advance, which makes me more calm in the process of listening to the lecture. By this way, it allows me to focus on learning what I didn't master well, it is very targeted.","In my opinion, the tutorial sheet can add more cases, so that we can understand the code in different scenarios, and then help us to master the coding more flexibly through the practice of more scenarios.","Workshop is a very good practice class. We can conduct targeted exercises in the workshop based on what we have learned in the lecture, and if we have any questions, we can always ask the teaching assistant to answer them. What a effective way to study!","Sorry, I haven't thought of good improvement suggestions yet."
